# CopyTrade (Under Development)

**CopyTrade** is a web application designed to help users manage and replicate trades across multiple trading accounts. In this application, a parent account is used to initiate trades, and the same actions are automatically copied to child accounts. The platform aims to provide various management features for handling multiple accounts efficiently.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a seamless experience for users who manage multiple trading accounts. It allows them to:
- Set one account as the **parent** and the rest as **child** accounts.
- Automatically replicate all trading actions from the parent account to the child accounts.
- Offer various account management features to streamline operations.

## Current Development

We are currently working on developing a **proof of concept (PoC)** for this application using:
- **Python** as the primary development language.
- **AngelOne Smart API** to interact with trading accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, make sure to install all the dependencies. These are listed in the `requirements_dev.txt` file.

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have all the required packages installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

### Proof of Concept
The PoC will demonstrate the basic functionality of copying trades from a parent account to one or more child accounts using the AngelOne Smart API.

## Future Plans
- **User-friendly interface** for account management.
- **Enhanced trade reporting** and analytics.
- **Real-time synchronization** of trades across multiple accounts.

Stay tuned for further updates as we progress through the development phases.
